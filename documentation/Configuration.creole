== Configuration
Three configurable files will be generated if they do not exist. They are: "config.yml", "groups.yml" and "players.yml".

=== config.yml

| Option  | Value(s)  | Description |
| ClearEmptyTeamsInterval | Integer | This feature clears empty teams left behind by other plugins (might fix lag!). This setting is expressed as an interval in seconds. |
| DatabaseVersion | Integer | Do NOT change this setting! |
| Debug | true/false | If enabled, NametagEdit will print out debug information to the console. |
| DisablePush  | true/false | If 'true', NametagEdit will prevent player pushing. This only works if both players have NametagEdit nametags. |
| MetricsEnabled  | true/false | If 'true', small amounts of data will be sent to MCstats.org so we can keep track of the plugin's popularity. |
| MySQL | true/false | If 'true', NametagEdit will use MySQL to store group/player data |
| RefreshTagOnWorldChange | true/false | If enabled, NametagEdit will refresh a player's nametag when they change worlds. |
| RefreshInterval | Integer | This feature will refresh all player's nametags on an interval expressed in seconds. |
| Tablist.Enabled | true/false | If enabled, NametagEdit will alter a user's name in the tab. |

=== groups.yml
Place your HIGHEST permission group at the top. At the top of the file there should be a group like "Owner" while the bottom should have something similar to "Default".

{{{
Groups:
  Owner: # This is the 'key' or the name to distinguish this group
     Permission: nte.owner # This is the permission required to have this nametag. You can change this to whatever.
     Prefix: '&2' # Both Prefix/Suffix are REQUIRED, even if they are blank. String length will be automatically trimmed 
     Suffix: '&f'
     SortPriority: 1
}}}

=== players.yml

{{{
Players:
  b5ccebaa-0623-4370-af73-0ec985dfa3b0: # This is the 'key' to identify the players
     Name: sgtcazeyt # This is the friendly name of the player
     Prefix: '&b' # Both Prefix/Suffix are REQUIRED, even if they are blank. String length will be automatically trimmed
     Suffix: '&c'
     SortPriority: 1
}}}

== Sorting Nametags

Server owners might want to arrange the tab list so nametags follow a certain order. You can accomplish this for both Groups & Players:
{{{
SortPriority: 1
}}}

SortPriority represents the position in TAB. If you set this to "1" you're saying, "Display this first". If you set it to "2", you're saying, "Display this second" -- and so on and so forth.

Suppose you have 2 ranks:
{{{
Groups:
  Admin:
    Permission: nte.admin
    Prefix: '&c'
    Suffix: '&f'
  Moderator:
    Permission: nte.moderator
    Prefix: '&2'
    Suffix: '&f'
}}}

And you want to display Admin first. You might do something like:
{{{
Groups:
  Admin:
    Permission: nte.admin
    Prefix: '&c'
    Suffix: '&f'
    SortPriority: 1 # 1 means it will display first
  Moderator:
    Permission: nte.moderator
    Prefix: '&2'
    Suffix: '&f'
    SortPriority: 2 # Means this will display second
}}}

To make the Moderator tag display first, we would simply reverse the Sort Priority. If there is no Sort Priority defined, then tags will randomly format in the tab. 
Scoreboard Team names are limited to 16 characters each. You can have several hundred distinct Sort Priorities without issues.

=== Players and Groups conflict
The sort priority MUST be UNIQUE to be used properly. For example, if you have SortPriority: 1 in both your Groups/Players files, then nametags will not be guaranteed to arrange properly. For example, if we have a rank
such as "Server Owner", we could set the SortPriority to 1, and then below that an "Admin" groups can have a SortPriority of 2. The same is true for if a player shares the same Sort Priority as a group.
